                  <p>
                    Microsoft Teams is a business communication platform created
                    by Microsoft. It's part of the Microsoft 365 suite of
                    products. It provides features like chat, video calls,
                    storing files, and connecting with other applications.

                  <h6>Overview</h6>
                  <p>
                    One day, I discovered that my friend was using Microsoft
                    Teams, while I use Slack daily and had no prior knowledge of
                    Microsoft Teams. My friend likes the software but
                    occasionally gets frustrated while using it. This sparked my
                    curiosity, and I decided to write a case study to explore
                    the differences between the two platforms.

              <p>
                I began researching Microsoft Teams and discovered that it is a
                powerful tool often utilized by large companies and those who
                frequently use Microsoft software. However, I encountered some
                issues with the software. Many people mention that some features
                and options are not always intuitive or easy to use.
                Additionally, the product lacks in notifications

              <h2>Goals</h2>
              <p>
                Often, big companies have very strict guidelines for design
                principles because they are closely tied to their brand name and
                goals. Furthermore, altering the design entails involving
                multiple teams and can be costly.
              </p>

                In this case study, I am going to focus more on the UX than the
                UI aspects, as I believe that minor UX improvements can
                significantly enhance usability for people.

                In the game industry, predicting user behavior can be
                challenging, even after conducting numerous user playtests.
                Sometimes, internet user reviews play a significant role in
                improving the product, as they provide genuine insights from
                users who interact with the product daily. Whenever I launch a
                game, I like to read comments online to understand what aspects
                users find uninteresting and what bugs they encounter. I use
                this method to gather user feedback.

              <h2>Testing</h2>
              <p>
                At my current company, we work closely with Microsoft, and some
                parts of our work involve using Microsoft applications. So, I
                downloaded the web application to test it. However, my version
                lacked real data, so I borrowed my friend's computer to test
                specific aspects with real data. After collecting this
                information, I allocated time to thoroughly test the product and
                understand the pain points mentioned by users.

              <h2>Solution</h2>
              <p>
                In this Case Study, I won't cover everything I found, so I'll
                focus on one scenario and provide a solution for it. I've chosen
                to address a frequent concern that many people have raised:
                notifications. I've identified areas where notifications are
                needed when actions are completed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some users also complained about excessive updates, so I
                brainstormed ways to make minor changes with a significant
                impact. I decided to
                <span>re-evaluate the process of creating new team channels</span>, as this is where teams communicate and share messages, tools,
                and files. Since the majority of users use
                <span>Android and desktop</span>, I conducted testing on these
                two platforms for the redesign.

                it appears as if I'm adding a friend. Since users can add as
                many members as they want, it would be beneficial to replace the
                icon with text for greater clarity. I've noticed that in the
                seven different chat apps I downloaded, they all use text

                Once the channel is created, it's better to inform the user that
                it's done, rather than simply sending them back to the main
                screen. There are two ways to solve this problem:
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span> Case 1:</span> Open the general channel that the users
                  created.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span> Case 2:</span> Show some interaction and place the
                  latest team at the top of the list.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>

                It was enjoyable to research the product that I use daily and
                the competitors' apps. Even though the concept is the same, the
                strengths vary significantly, and some are quite powerful. In
                the future I would like to run the user test to hear the real
                feedback from users.
